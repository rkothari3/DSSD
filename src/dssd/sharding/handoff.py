"""Cross-shard agent hand-off, fenced by the destination's Raft term so
a stale or since-deposed leader can't accept one - the same
epoch-fencing pattern used for the DiLoCo trainer's leader gate.

Consistency policy: the destination commits the agent to its own
replicated log *before* acknowledging acceptance (see
ShardStateMachine.propose_and_confirm), and the caller only removes the
agent from its source shard after seeing that acceptance. A crash
between those two steps can produce a transient duplicate (the agent
briefly exists in both shards) but never a loss - duplication is the
safer failure mode to prefer here.
