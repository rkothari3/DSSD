"""Polls worker loss over wall-clock and logs it to CSV - the raw data
behind the loss-vs-wall-clock-at-N-kills comparison plot. Loss is
averaged across whichever workers answer each poll, the standard
local-SGD convention for approximating a single "global" curve from
workers that are mid-inner-loop on their own local batches.
